# todo-it

todo-it will be a basic ToDo application written in Python. Some features that
I look forward to adding include:

- **Task Priority**: The ability to drag-and-drop tasks within your ToDo list
to change task priority. Saves priority state.
- **Overdue Tasks**: Will display overdue tasks in red before the current
day's tasks.
- **Task Editing**: The ability to edit a task including adding descriptions,
changing task date, changing task priority manually.
- **Task Time Estimation**: The ability to input a time estimation along with
how long the task actually took to complete.
- **Time Estimation Recommendations**: Functionality in the application that
can look at similar tasks you have completed in the past and give a better time
estimation. Will be able to be overridden by the user.
- **Timer**: A task timer that you can start when starting a task, pause, and
stop when you are completed with the task. Will work hand in hand with time
estimation recommendations. Will be able to be configured to automatically send
an alert when it's time to take a break (user configurable).
- **Task Tagging**: The ability to add tags to your tasks such as "school",
"work", "chores", etc.
- **Statistics**: A report page that shows you total time spent on tasks as
well as total time per task tag.
- **Habit Tracker**: A page where you can create habits and check them off
daily. It will look similar to github commit history graph for each habit.
