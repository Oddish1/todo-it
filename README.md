# todo-it

ToDo It is a basic todo application written in Python using Flask. Some features that
I look forward to adding include:

- **Task Priority**: The ability to drag-and-drop tasks within your ToDo list
to change task priority. Saves priority state.
- **Overdue Tasks**: Will display overdue tasks in red before the current
day's tasks.
- **Task Editing**: The ability to edit a task including adding descriptions,
changing task date, changing task priority manually.
- **Task Tagging**: The ability to add tags to your tasks such as "school",
"work", "chores", etc.
- **Habit Tracker**: A page where you can create habits and check them off
daily. It will look similar to github commit history graph for each habit.
- **Timer**: A task timer that you can start when starting a task, pause, and
stop when you are completed with the task.
- **Statistics**: A report page that shows you total time spent on tasks as
well as total time per task tag.
